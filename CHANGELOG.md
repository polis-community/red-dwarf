- Add automatic padding to polis implementation when cluster centroid guesses are provided.
- Add `PolisKMeans` scikit-learn estimator with:
  - cluster initialization strategy matching Polis,

  - new instance variable `init_centers_used_` to allow inspection of guesses used.
- Allow passing KMeans `init` strategy into `find_optimal_k()`.
- Remove `pad_centroid_list_to_length` helper function.
